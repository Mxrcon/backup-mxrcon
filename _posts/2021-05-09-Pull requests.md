I've been working on a lot of Pull requests almost 15 at the same time, that was a very good experience to learn how to use git and how to interact with other projects on GitHub. 
I updated the template, and very soon, as soon as I have time, I'll create my own template to this github pages. I'm becaming used to Open source project, and I really believe that the
science should follow the open source colaboration path.
